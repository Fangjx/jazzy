 <h1>Jazzy Spellchecker</h1>
 
 This spellchecker directly uses the Jazzy spellchecker classes, and as such offers an entirely Java based spellchecking solution. There are just two menu commands, 'Spell check selection' is pretty self explanatory - if there is no text selected the whole document is checked; 'Unload Dictionary' simply unloads the dictionary from memory this may be an issue if the dictionary used is fairly large. If the dictionary is large, it is advised to increase the maximum heap size.
 
 <h2>Options</h2>
 
 The options that can be accessed through the Jazzy options pane include specifying the location of the dictionary, and allowing the dictionary to load on startup (this will considerably slow startup time if a large dictionary is used, but will speed up the first spellcheck).
